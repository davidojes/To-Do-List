This is an ASP .NET implementation of the popular To-Do List Beginner Project

My goal is to learn how to perform basic CRUD operations and to understand how the .NET ecosystem works.
The first iteration will have pages that reload to communicate with the server.
The second iteration will use JQuery and AJAX to have non-reloading communication.


* This app displays To-Do List items in a Razor Page that is read from an SQL Database .
* It is designed with CSS and added behaviour (features like click to delete) is implemented with JavaScript.
* To-Do List app can currently Create, Read (View) and Delete To-Do List Items.
* Update coming soon.

* Yet to have responsive design with CSS.
* Will update the colour scheme and design.
