This is an ASP .NET implementation of the popular To-Do List Beginner Project

My goal is to learn how to perform CRUD operations and to understand how the .NET ecosystem works.
The first iteration will have pages that reload to communicate with the server.
The second iteration will use JQuery and AJAX to have non-reloading communication.
